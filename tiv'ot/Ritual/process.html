        the ritual starts with three high shamans casting <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:beacon-of-hope">Beacon of Hope</a> at 9th level,
        connecting the individual to a more spiritual plane, allowing the god to more easily enter their body.
    </p>
    <p>
        three more clerics outside the circle procured 3 bowls of acid, whilst another gathered a bowl of molten gold. these items are set aside
    </p>
    <p>
        the three high shamans than bring forth five shards made of a white, pale, glowing metal. two others bring forth whips with shards
        of dragon bone attached to the ends. the third brring forth a karambit made from black and purple material.
        the whips are used to flay the targets back, whilst the karambit is used to make precise cresenst shaped cuts into the torso of the target.
    </p>
    <p>
        the shamans than proceed to chant to ringuluos the herald, and before death, the shamans draw the shards of metal and place them into the body,
        2 into the sholders, one into the sternum at the jugular notch, one into the heart and one into the stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
        the target than dies.
    </p>
    <p>
        the target is left in a "black void" where they are confronted by a soft golden glow, which upon embrace, brings the target back to life,
        left only with the scars of the whips and knife, and a tatoo upon the base of the neck. the shamans than precure a bolwl of black inky liquid
        smelling of acid and sugar. 
    </p>
    <p>
        upon consumption of the liquid part of ringuluos the herald enters the body of the target, and the ritual is complete.
