        the main structure of the town works in stages relating to the <a href="social value.html">social value</a>of those who
        live in the houses. where the <a href="social value.html">highest</a> up individuals would live at the center of the 
        town, usually in houses made of fine clay and built upon fine stone foundations. this small circle of those houses are 
        seen as the center of town, and the rest branchese out from there. the rest of the buildings then branch off slowly decreasing
        in quality and cost, as the ocupants slowly become worth less and less to <a href="social value.html">society</a>
        where the houses start to loose the stone foundation, than progress to simple thatch roofs, than progress down to shacks
        that could be seen as the "slums"
