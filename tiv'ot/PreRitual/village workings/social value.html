        the social value of the village is determined based on how the people follow the <a href="../religion/values.html">values</a>
        of ringuluos the herald, this means that those who dont break the values are held in a high regard, and are seen as being of the 
        highest social value, while those who break the values are seen as being of low social value. there are 3 different tiers of social
        value within the village, high shaman/religios folk, common folk, and "squatters". the differnt tiers are sepperated from each other
        via heavy social stigmas, where those lower to you are seen as orders of magniture more wortheless than you, and those above you are seen
        as being orders of magniture more worthy than you, being nearly akin to dieties.
