        as the <a href="/ruin and revalry/tiv'ot/Ritual/process.html">ritual</a> ended tiv'ot was immediately delved into insanity as a god entered his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
        most of this stage in life is spent in a state of madness, and has no sense of time, or any
        meaningful memories/interactions with others. as tiv'ot is in this state, he mostly in a state
        of "limbo" between reality and the madness of his mind. this stage lasted an indeterminate amout
        of time
    </p>
    <p>
        eventually tiv'ot begins to regain bits of sanity, though is still mostly mad and confused. he spends
        this pondering about fragmnted memorys of his tribe, and thier ways of life. 
    </p>
    <p>
        though tiv'ot is certain that the tribes ways are the objective way of life, through madness and
        fractured minds he has only a vague idea of what these ways are.
    </p>
    <p>
        this stage lasts over 50'000 years, with tiv'ot slowly regaining bits of sanity and memory.
