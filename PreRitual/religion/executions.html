        the executions of the tribe were simple and effective.

    <p>
        the tribe simply took those who are needing executions and beheaded them. they would, in most cases use the <body>
        to fertilize crops. the head would be placed on top of an anthill, and would only be retrieved when it was free from
        flesh and blood. the now clean skull would be nailed to an apropriate shrine. the delicacy and care of the nailing procedure
        would be decided on the <a href="/PreRitual/village workings/social value.html">social value</a>of the person. where the higher
        up people would usually be nailed carefully with little fractures and cracks, where those who were inferior whould be nailed
        with little care and remorce, usually ending up as a lone nail and a pile of bone at the floor. this is mainly due 
        to how the worker <a href="/PreRitual/villageTraditions.html">sees</a> the individual.
